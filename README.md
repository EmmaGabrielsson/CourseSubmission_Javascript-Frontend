# CourseSubmission JS-FE GBG

This is my examining submission for the course JavaScript Frontend, program Webbutvecklare inom .NET, at EC-utbildning Göteborg.

Which includes:
1.	Introduction and deepening within JavaScript
2.	Troubleshooting and error handling
3.	Change web page content dynamically
4.	Handle events from the user
5.	Download and send data to the server
6.	Manage data in the browser
7.	Continuous versioning with Git
8.	Cleaned code (unified, formatted, restructured)
9.	Code free of obvious bugs
10.	Tests have been used where appropriate


 In this submission I have created a foundation for a dynamically controlled web page, a webshop that display products with five relevant properties in a gallery fetched from an open API (https://fakestoreapi.com/). The user can add products to a shopping cart, from which the user can see the added products with title, image, price and quantity. From the shopping cart the user also can remove added products and select different product quantities. And all content in the shopping cart still remains even if the page is refreshed because it is saved in the users local storage. The user can also make more web-API calls to fill the page with more or different content from the API than is showed at first visit, by using the “category”-dropdown-menu-button to navigate to the described content, still on the same page. 

To show other request calls to a server I have added a jsonPlaceholder file where post, put and delete requests are handled to JSONPlaceholder (https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) server. And the requests can be viewed by clicking different buttons in the users shopping cart with response in console.log and some alert() messages.

Different events are added with different functions to change the layout, so lets checkout the project now. Happy visit!
